            I know this letter is late now when I give you, but I hope you see this letter. I want to take a moment to express my gratitude for the friendship we build. You have been such a wonderful friend, and I wanted to let you know how much your presence in my life means to me.
        </p>
       	    First of all, when we review the lessons it is fun. Sometimes, learning can be quite challenging, and your patience and understanding when I explain the lesson to you even though I can explain it clearly. Also thank you for, when the topic is not immediately clear to me. You have an incredible way of explaining complex concepts in a way that I can easily comprehend.
        </p>

            Second, your humor has been a constant source of joy for me. Even when I don't quite understand all of your jokes, your laughter is infectious, and it's impossible not to smile when you're around. I'm grateful to have a friend who can brighten my day. Beyond the laughter, you've been a source of comfort. Typically, I am quite reserved, but with you, I find it easier to open up and express myself.
        </p>
        </p>
            Third, your writing is nothing short of amazing. The way you express your thoughts and emotions through words is amazing. It has been a privilege to read your words and to gain insight into your thoughts and experiences. I'm continually inspired by your creativity and your talent for expressing heartfelt emotions through words. TOTOO to ah, bahala ka dyan kung ayaw mo maniwala. Pero ganda talaga ng paggawa ng mga poem saka ang ganda ng writing style mo.
        </p>
        </p>
            Lastly, I also want to express my gratitude for being my first friend. The bond we've formed is incredibly special, and I look forward to the many more adventures and experiences we'll share as we continue this incredible journey of friendship together.
        </p>
        </p>
            Thank you for being such an amazing friend and being my serendipity, and here's to many more years of laughter, comfort, and countless inside jokes, even if I don't always get them! (●'◡'●)
