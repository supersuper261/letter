            I know this letter is late now when I give you, but I hope you see this letter. I just want to say how grateful I am for the friendship we've developed. I wanted to let you know how much I value having you in my life since you have been such a great friend.
        </p>
       	    First of all, reviewing the lessons is enjoyable. Learning may be difficult at times, therefore I appreciate your patience and understanding when I try to explain a lesson to you but am unable to do it clearly. And I appreciate you taking the time to explain the lesson to me so that it is simpler for me to grasp.

            Second, your humor has been a constant source of joy for me. Even when I don't quite understand all of your jokes, your laughter is infectious, and it's impossible not to smile when you're around. I'm grateful to have a friend who can brighten my day. Beyond the laughter, you've been a source of comfort. Typically, I am quite reserved, but with you, I find it easier to open up and express myself.
        </p>
        </p>
            Thirdly, your writing is simply outstanding. It's amazing how well you convey your feelings and thoughts in words. Reading your writings and learning about your ideas and experiences has been something special. TOTOO to ah, bahala ka dyan kung ayaw mo maniwala. Pero ganda talaga ng paggawa ng mga poem.
        </p>
        </p>
            Lastly, I also want to express my gratitude for being my first friend. The bond we've formed is incredibly special, and I'm looking forward to our journey of friendship together.
        </p>
        </p>
            Thank you for being such an amazing friend, and here's to many more years of laughter, comfort, and countless inside jokes, even if I don't always get them! Please don't get tired of me too. (●'◡'●)
        </p>
        <p>Sincerely, </p>
